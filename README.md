# LOCALHOST SERVER : run
I am using python's buildin http.server. CD to whatever directory you placed this repo and, at the CLI:   
python -m http.server 4040  
And in the browser: 
http://localhost:4040/

# TDD : run 
node tdd.js
Sadly - For Stackblizt's purposes I had shoved ALL the index.js into index.html. And thus sort of rendering the tdd.js moot.
